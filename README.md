# hello-world
My first repository

Hi guys!

If you read it,you'll find there is nothing important for you. 

It's just a task for a freshman on github.

Based on the Guidesï¼ŒI should write a bit about myself.

Absolutely,I'll tell you a bit unless you still focus on what I am writing....

Congratulations,you find someone who will give you requirements.

That is to say,I don't code.

Ok cool.I'm here to make friends with you guys.

By the way,I will learn more coding as possible as I can if I can't find you coding for me.

hhhhhh
